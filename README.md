<p>Water conservation is our collective responsibility.
</p>
<h3>Recently, some people have started to consume water in an abnormal way without any benefit. This has caused a decrease in water and climate. We must all conserve water and consume only what we need. </h3>

  <h3>The temperature in the summer can be very dangerous for the health of children and the elderly. This group is more vulnerable to the ultraviolet rays produced by the sun in the summer. Drink plenty of water and do not go out in the sun a lot.</h3>
